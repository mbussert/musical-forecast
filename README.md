# musical-forecast
A web application to generate music based on the user's specified location.

## OVERVIEW 

HTML

We started this project by creating a basic HTML file with sections where our data would be displayed. After that, we decided who would be working on what section and split up.

WEATHER.JS

For this file, we created a promise that fetches the current forecast and on the fetch the five day forecast. Included in this file are two click functions. Both are used to get the output of the searched city. One is for the transition page and the other for the home page.

MUSIC.JS

For the music.js file, we created an onload function that includs the redirection to the client id and password, and saves to local storage. This file contains a function to get a playlist and a function to get the tracks. We also created a function to display the music being played. Most of the work in this file was spent creating functions to allow users to fully access our webpage after logging in to their personal spotify account.
