# musical-forecast
A web application to generate music based on the user's specified location.

## OVERVIEW 

HTML
We started this project by creating a basic HTML file with sections where our data would be displayed. After that, we decided who would be working on what section and split up.

WEATHER.JS

For this file, we created a promise that fetches the current forecast and on the fetch the five day forecast. Included in this file are two click functions. Both are used to get the output of the searched city. One is for the transition page and the other for the home page.
